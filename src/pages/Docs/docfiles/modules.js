        On your local system, you can install everything globally (through yum/apt, or just with root) and there aren't really any consequences. This is 
        totally fine locally, but on the HPC, we can't just be installing packages willy-nilly (if they're even available as yum packages in the first place).
        Instead, we install them as modules, and every user can load them with <code>module load modulename</code> to put them in their path.
