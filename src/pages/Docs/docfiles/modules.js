        On your local system, you can install everything globally (through yum/apt, or just with root) and there aren't really any consequences. This is 
        totally fine locally, but on the HPC, we can't just be installing packages willy-nilly (if they're even available as yum packages in the first place).
        Instead, we install them as modules, and every user can load them with <code>module load modulename</code> to put them in their path. This software all
        goes into the <code>/opt/software</code> directory while the module files go into <code>/opt/modulefiles</code>. We'll go over module files later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something to keep in mind is that all these modules must be installed from source. The content of the modules must be contained within that
        <code> software</code> folder. Keep in mind this applies to tooling that developers use too. This includes things like Python, PHP, Anaconda, etc.

      <h4>Modulefiles</h4>

      <p>
        Module files are written in Tcl. It's not really important that you know Tcl itself, but rather how modules are composed. In the <code>/opt/modulefiles</code>
        folder, there's a file called <code>template</code>. To make a new module, copy that file and replace the fields with the information for the new
        module. Make the new module has its own folder.
